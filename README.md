#ElectricGamesFrontend 
is the frontend part of the ElectricGames project, a website that allows users to add, remove, and purchase games. This frontend is built using TypeScript, React, and the Axios library to connect to the local port of the .NET server. The server, in turn, retrieves game data from the API, which is connected to a SQLite database.

Installation
To install and run the ElectricGamesFrontend project, follow these steps:

git clone https://github.com/faom002/ElectricGamesFrontend.git

cd ElectricGamesFrontend

npm install

npm start

This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser. You can now interact with the ElectricGames website, add games, remove games, and make purchases.

Feel free to explore the codebase, make modifications, and customize the application to suit your needs.
